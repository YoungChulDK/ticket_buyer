# functions :

1- ```main_clicker.py```
This is a better version since it clicks on the available ticket and open the browser for you so you can react in due time

2- ``` main.py ```

This will see when the ticket is available and open the page for you so you can choose it yourself.

```
python.exe main_clicker.py
